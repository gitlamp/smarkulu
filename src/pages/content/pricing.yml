          question: "Members of my project or organization are more than 10 now, do i have to pay for the additional members only?"
          answer: "You need to pay for the entire project or organization, not just for additional members. When an organization or project is upgraded to business and  professional plans, more features are added to them, and all project members can use them. Payment must also be made for all members."

          question: "What is the difference between monthly and annual payments and why is the monthly payment more expensive?"
          answer: "You must pay a monthly fee if you select our monthly payment plan, but when you choose to pay annually, we will give you a discount as a thank you. For example, if you make a monthly payment, you have to pay a monthly amount of 9 dollars per person, which is 108 dollars per year. But if you pay annually, you have to pay 72 dollars per person, a little over 30% savings."
        -
          question: "Can I add new members after making a payment?"
          answer: "Yes, you can. The amount you pay for new members will be calculated according to how many days are remaining till the end of your plan and a new invoice will be issued to you. For example, if the plan you bought was monthly and only 10 days left by the end of the month for your new member, you should only pay for the remaining 10 days."
        -
          question: "Can I remove the member after payment and add a new member instead?"

        -
          question: "If I decide to delete a member after payment, will it be added to my account credit?"
