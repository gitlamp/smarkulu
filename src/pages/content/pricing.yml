          question: "Members of my project or organization are more than 10 now, do i have to pay for the additional members only?"
          answer: "You need to pay for the entire project or organization, not just additional members. When an organization or project is upgraded to business and professional plans, more features are added to them, and all project members can use them. Payment must also be made for all members."
        -
          question: "What is the difference between monthly and annual payments and why is the monthly payment more expensive?"
          answer: "You must pay a monthly fee if you select our monthly payment plan, but when you choose to pay annually, we will give you a discount as a thank you. For example, if you make a monthly payment, you have to pay a monthly amount of 9 dollars per person, which is 108 dollars per year. But if you pay annually, you have to pay 72 dollars per person, a little over 30% savings."
        -
          question: "Can I add new members after making a payment?"
          answer: "Yes, you can. The amount you pay for new members will be calculated based on remaining days till the end of your plan and a new invoice will be issued for you. For example, if the plan you bought was monthly and only 10 days left by the end of the month, you should only pay for the remaining 10 days for your new member."
        -
          question: "Can I remove a member and replace her with a new member after upgrading to a paid plan?"
          answer: "Yes, you can delete members and add other members in their stead to your project or organization. No extra payment is required for replacement."
        -
          question: "If I decide to delete a member after payment, will you remove refund me for that member automatically?"
          answer: "No, if you remove a member after the payment, the cost you paid for that member will not be added to your account automatically. If you want to delete a member, you can contact Taskulu support team and we add Taskulu credit to your account for your deleted member."
        -
          question: "Can I upgrade a personal project to business plan, or an organization and it's projects to professional plan?"
          answer: |
            No, business plan is for organizations, and professional plan is for personal projects. If you decided to upgrade a project you created in an organization to professional plan, you must first make sure it's not part of any organization, namely it's a personal project.<br/>
